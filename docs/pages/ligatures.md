# Ligatures

Ligatures are a feature of fonts where a specified sequence of characters is recognized and replaced with a single new character that you design. _Ligatures can have any sequence of two or more characters_. In a text editing program that has ligatures enabled, this sequence of characters is recognized, then replaced with the custom ligature character that you design.

You can learn more about Ligatures over at the [Data types / Ligatures](../data-types/ligatures) article.
