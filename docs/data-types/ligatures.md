# Ligatures

Ligatures are `Glyph` data type - they are a feature of fonts where a specified sequence of characters is recognized and replaced with a single new character that you design. 

Some common Latin ligatures have an assigned Unicode code point (so, some Ligatures are Unicode Characters). But, *Ligatures can be defined by any sequence of two or more characters*. In a text editing program that has ligatures enabled, this sequence of characters is recognized, then replaced with the custom ligature character that you design. These custom Ligature characters are part of a font file, but they do not have an associated Unicode code point (some Ligatures are not Unicode Characters).

In Latin, there are some common ligatures: 

`ae` -> `æ`,&emsp;  `AE` -> `Æ`,&emsp;  `ff` -> `ﬀ`,&emsp;  `fi` -> `ﬁ`,&emsp;  `fl` -> `ﬂ`,&emsp;  `oe` -> `œ`,&emsp;  `OE` -> `Œ`,&emsp;  `st` -> `ﬆ`,&emsp;  `ffi` -> `ﬃ`,&emsp;  `ffl` -> `ﬄ`
