## v2.0.0-beta.1.0
released 2023-06-01

### Description
Beta 1 is (hopefully) mostly stable from a Project File perspective. 
It also introduces two new areas of functionality in addition to several minor improvements.

### Main features

### Minor features
 - Fancy brand update with new logos, icons, and the "Oblegg" example font.
 - Lots of updates to make SVG import/export better.
 - Improved tab layouts for content pages - Help, About, and Settings.
 - Getting Started or First Run content for Components and Ligatures.
 - Updated help content.
 - Project summary information on the Overview page.
 - Renamed "Glyphs" to "Characters" (in the UI and in the code).
