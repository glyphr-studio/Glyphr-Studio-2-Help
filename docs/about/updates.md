## v2.0.0-alpha.1
released 2022-00-00

### Description
The aim of Alpha 1 is to test some pieces of Glyphr Studio v2. 
Glyphr Studio is in Alpha because it is not a complete product yet.
But feedback and bug-hunting on the following scenarios would be very 
helpful:

 - Navigate around using the upper-left Page button, and the Glyph Chooser
 - Create new shapes on the edit canvas
 - Resize shapes with the arrow tool
 - Edit paths with the pen tool
 - Edit glyph, path, and path point details from the Attributes panel
