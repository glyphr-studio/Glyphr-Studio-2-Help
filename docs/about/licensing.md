# Licensing
This page outlines the license of the Glyphr Studio App itself, and the license of fonts you create.
## The Glyphr Studio App

Glyphr Studio, the font editing software code itself, is licensed under GPL v3.0, which is an open-source 
license. You can read more about it in the GitHub repository: 

https://github.com/glyphr-studio/Glyphr-Studio-2


## Fonts that you create
A common question we get is 'Who owns the fonts I create with Glyphr Studio?' The short answer is, you do!

As with all creative works, the creator of those works has full rights to what they create. That means you decide what type of license is applied to your work.

Glyphr Studio has no rights to the fonts you create. A company or person may create a tool, and unless there is some specific legal document signed by you stating otherwise, the tool maker has no rights to what you created with that tool. If you are a novelist, the company that made the text editing software you use to write your novel does not own the rights to your novel. Same goes for Glyphr Studio and the fonts you make with it.

### What license should I choose?
Really, that's up to you to research and decide. We aren't lawyers, after all :-)

But, if you would like to license your font as Open Source, the most common license for Open Source Fonts is the SIL Open Font License (OFL). You can read about exactly what that means here: https://scripts.sil.org/OFL

### How do I license my font?
Putting license information in your OTF font is easy. On the Font Settings page, scroll down to the OTF section. There are two fields, 'license' and 'licenseURL'. If, for example, you want to use an OFL license, you would put:


|license: | OFL 1.1 |
| :--- | :--- |
|**licenseURL:** | **https://scripts.sil.org/OFL** |

It's also common, if you are distributing your font files, to place them in a .zip along with one or two text files that describe the licensing. OFL provides these text files, as would any other license type.
