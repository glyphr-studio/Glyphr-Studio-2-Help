In the Glyph attribute card, you can select the &quot;Get Paths From Another Project&quot; action. This will launch a glyph chooser dialog that displays items from the other project. Once you select an item, it&#39;s shapes will be copied from the other project into the current one.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="Welcome screen for Cross-project Actions"></p><p>The other main benefit of having two open projects is that it unlocks Cross-project Actions.

Cross-project actions aim to meet these scenarios - and even extends the idea to Kern Groups and project settings.</p><p>Component instances / component roots are the big thing that is not possible when merging two projects. In order to safely move glyphs, each one has their component instance links &#39;resolved&#39; before the move. So, the destination glyph will look the same as the source glyph, but, importantly, the component instances will all be converted to regular stand-alone paths.</p><p>Moving characters or ligatures while maintaining all their current component links would be an incredibly complex action, and is not currently possible.</p><h2 id="details-for-each-cross-project-action" tabindex="-1">Details for each cross-project action <a class="header-anchor" href="#details-for-each-cross-project-action" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Details for each cross-project action&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="copy-character-or-ligature-shapes" tabindex="-1">Copy character or ligature shapes <a class="header-anchor" href="#copy-character-or-ligature-shapes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Copy character or ligature shapes&quot;">​</a></h3>',23),_=s('<p>This action will take a copy of each path (or paths from a resolved component link) from the source project and insert them into the same character in the destination project.</p><p>Glyph-level data will not be copied over (with the exception of the Advance Width option below), this action only deals with path-level objects.</p><p>If the character or ligature object does not exist in the destination project, a default one will be created.</p><blockquote><p>Options:</p><ul><li>Scale copied items, if the source and destination Em sizes do not match.</li><li>Update the destination item&#39;s Advance Width to maintain right-side bearing.</li><li>Reverse copied shapes&#39; windings.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="overwrite-characters-or-ligatures" tabindex="-1">Overwrite characters or ligatures <a class="header-anchor" href="#overwrite-characters-or-ligatures" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overwrite characters or ligatures&quot;">​</a></h3>',5),f=e("p",null,"This action will take the selected characters or ligatures from the source project, and add them to the destination project.
