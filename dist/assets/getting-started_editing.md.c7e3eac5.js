The Panels area displays data in various lists or inputs. The Attributes Panel, for example, displays a series of Cards that has detailed information about whatever is currently selected. These cards have properties that you can edit, and those changes will update on the Edit Canvas (and vise-versa, changes on the Edit Canvas will update the detail cards).
