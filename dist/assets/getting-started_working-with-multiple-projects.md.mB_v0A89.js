In the Glyph attribute card, you can select the &quot;Get Paths From Another Project&quot; action. This will launch a glyph chooser dialog that displays items from the other project. Once you select an item, it&#39;s shapes will be copied from the other project into the current one.</p><p><img src="'+u+'" alt="Welcome screen for Cross-project Actions"></p><p>The other main benefit of having two open projects is that it unlocks Cross-project Actions.

Cross-project actions aim to meet these scenarios - and even extends the idea to Kern Groups and project settings.</p><p>Component instances / component roots are the big thing that is not possible when merging two projects. In order to safely move glyphs, each one has their component instance links &#39;resolved&#39; before the move.
