Components lets you define and re-use a collection of paths across many different glyphs. The root is called a &#39;Component&#39; and these are added by reference to other glyphs, where they are called &#39;Component Instances&#39;. Updating the root component will also update all component instances.</p><p>Glyphr Studio Components are not exported to fonts - it is a concept that is only in place to help design a font. All Component Instances will be exported to your font, along with regular Paths, as standard font outlines.</p><h2 id="component-roots-and-component-instances" tabindex="-1">Component Roots and Component Instances <a class="header-anchor" href="#component-roots-and-component-instances" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Component Roots and Component Instances&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>The link between roots and instances is shown on both glyphs, making it easy to navigate back and forth.</p><p>Any Glyph object (Character, Ligature, or Component) can be used as a component root. When you are on the edit page for a glyph that is being used as a root component, a card with a list of links will be shown in the panel area. Clicking on one of these links will navigate you to the other glyph that is using the root as a Component Instance.</p><p>Component Instances are shown along-side Paths - in both the Layers panel, and as a Component Instance card that is similar to the Path card in the Attributes panel. There will also be a link when a Component Instance is selected that will navigate you back to the Root Component glyph.</p><p>In the Layers Panel as well as on the Edit Canvas, regular paths have a ðŸŸ¦Blue accent color. Component Instances have a ðŸŸ©Green accent color.</p><h2 id="component-instance-transforms" tabindex="-1">Component Instance transforms <a class="header-anchor" href="#component-instance-transforms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Component Instance transforms&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>Many times, you&#39;ll only need to use the Component Instance with no changes with regards to it&#39;s Component Root. But, you may have to move, resize, or otherwise adjust a Component Instance to make it work in the destination glyph.</p><p>Component Instances <em>do not</em> have size or position attributes. Everything is in relation to it&#39;s Root Component. Component Instances only have x and y offsets, changes in width and height, and other transform information. This way, when the Root Component is edited, a Component Instance inherits all the changes, and then applies any additional transforms as needed.</p><h3 id="available-transforms" tabindex="-1">Available transforms <a class="header-anchor" href="#available-transforms" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Available transforms&quot;">â€‹</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th>TransformÂ name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Î”Â x</strong> and <strong>Î”Â y</strong></td><td>The difference in x or y position, as compared to the Root Component.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Î”Â width</strong> and <strong>Î”Â height</strong></td><td>The difference in width or height, as compared to the Root Component.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>flip vertical</strong></td><td>Flip top to bottom, as compared to the Root Component.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>flip horizontal</strong></td><td>Flip left to right, as compared to the Root Component.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>reverse winding</strong></td><td>Reverse all the windings, as compared to the paths in the Root Component.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>rotation</strong></td><td>Number of degrees of rotation* as compared to the Root Component.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>rotate first</strong></td><td>When applying both rotation and size changes to a shape, the order of rotate/resize or resize/rotate will end up with two different results.

The bottom of the circle (6 o&#39;clock or 180Â°) the values switch between positive and negative. So, rotating a shape counter-clockwise will use angle values -1Â° through -179Â°, and rotating a shape clockwise will use angle values 0Â° through 180Â°.</p>',14),r=[s];function i(h,l,d,p,c,m){return e(),o("div",null,r)}const u=t(a,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,u as default};
