From left to right, the first area is the Panels area. There is a thin area in the middle to select Tools.

The Panels area displays data in various lists or inputs. The Attributes Panel, for example, displays a series of Cards that has detailed information about whatever is currently selected. These cards have properties that you can edit, and those changes will update on the Edit Canvas (and vise-versa, changes on the Edit Canvas will update the detail cards). Cards also display various actions you can take on that selected item.</p><p>Here are the main panels and their function:</p><ul><li><strong>Attributes</strong> - Shows the detail cards for the current selection. <ul><li><strong>Glyph</strong> - if nothing is selected, the Glyph card is the only one displayed.</li><li><strong>Path</strong> - shows information about the currently selected Path.</li><li><strong>Path Point</strong> - shows information about the currently selected point on the path.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Layers</strong> - Shows the shapes in the current item in their stack order.</li><li><strong>Context characters</strong> - Specify other characters to show around the character you are currently editing.</li><li><strong>Transforms</strong> - Select paths to have one of the available transforms applied: <ul><li>Horizontal skew - provide either an angle or a distance to skew selected paths.</li><li>Offset path - provide a (positive) distance to expand selected paths, or a negative distance to shrink them.</li><li>Rotation - provide an angle to rotate selected paths or component instances.</li></ul></li><li><strong>History</strong> - A list of actions in the Undo queue.</li><li><strong>Guides</strong> - Show, hide, and edit built in and custom guide lines.</li><li><strong>Character info</strong> - Various pieces of metadata from Unicode about the current character.</li><li><strong>Quality checks</strong> - Toggle various best practices to have them highlighted on the Edit Canvas.</li></ul><h2 id="tools" tabindex="-1">Tools <a class="header-anchor" href="#tools" aria-label="Permalink to “Tools”">​</a></h2><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Edit Tool</th><th>Icon</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>New Rectangle</td><td><img src="'+s+'" alt="Icon Tool - New Rectangle"></td><td>Draws a new rectangle path with four corner points (that don&#39;t have handles).</td></tr><tr><td>New Oval</td><td><img src="'+n+'" alt="Icon Tool - New Oval"></td><td>Draws a new oval path.</td></tr><tr><td>New Path</td><td><img src="'+d+'" alt="Icon Tool - New Path"></td><td>Draws a new path.

Alternatively, if you have some SVG code copied to your OS Clipboard, you can click on the Edit Canvas to give it focus, then press <code>Ctrl</code> <code>V</code> to paste, which will import that SVG code to the current item. Your Glyphr Studio clipboard has to be empty for this to work (there is a &#39;Clear Glyphr Studio Clipboard&#39; command on the Glyph card).</p><p>Three things to note that will help importing SVG directly to the edit canvas:</p><ul><li>It is very helpful if your SVG document is set up such that 1px = 1em. Otherwise, your imported shapes may be very large or very small compared to the font design space.</li><li>There is a setting &quot;Move shapes when importing SVG file&quot; which by default is turned off. When turned on, this will move the imported shapes to near the origin. Sometimes SVG data has unexpected overall positioning for imported shapes.</li><li>There is a more advanced setting called &quot;Add default Side Bearings when importing an SVG file&quot; which overrides the previous setting. This setting will not only move the imported shapes, but it will also add in Left and Right Side Bearings to give the imported shape an overall Advance Width.</li></ul><h3 id="view-controls" tabindex="-1">View controls <a class="header-anchor" href="#view-controls" aria-label="Permalink to “View controls”">​</a></h3><p>Along the bottom there are canvas view controls, from left to right they are:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>View Tool</th><th>Icon</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Pan</td><td><img src="'+u+'" alt="Icon Tool - Pan"></td><td>Move the view left / right / up / down.

Fill mode is similar to a preview of the actual character after it&#39;s exported. Outline mode allows you to see all of the shapes outlined, which may help when editing complex shapes. In outline mode, clockwise paths will be shown as a slightly lighter blue outline than their counter-clockwise counterparts. Component Instances will be outlined in dark green.</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom 1:1</td><td><img src="'+y+'" alt="Icon Tool - Zoom 1:1"></td><td>The Zoom 1:1 button sets the zoom level such that 1 pixel on your screen is equal to 1 Em unit from your project.</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom to fit</td><td><img src="'+f+'" alt="Icon Tool - Zoom to fit"></td><td>This will auto-fit the current glyph to however big your window is currently.</td></tr><tr><td>Live Preview</td><td><img src="'+b+'" alt="Icon Tool - Live Preview"></td><td>Pop out a second screen for a live preview of your font.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>You can also use the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl</code> <code>Space</code> to toggle the Distraction Free Preview.
